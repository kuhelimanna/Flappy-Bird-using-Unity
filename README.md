# Flappy-Bird-using-Unity


Flappy Bird Unity Clone
This is a simple Flappy Bird game clone developed using Unity and C#. The game is inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a series of obstacles.

Gameplay
The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through a series of pipes without hitting them. The player can control the bird by tapping the screen (or pressing a designated key) to make it flap its wings and ascend. The bird descends automatically, and the player must time their taps carefully to avoid colliding with the pipes. Each successful passage through a pair of pipes earns the player one point. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

Features
Simple one-touch controls for easy gameplay.
Randomly generated pipe obstacles to provide endless replayability.
Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
Game over screen displaying the player's score and providing the option to restart the game.
